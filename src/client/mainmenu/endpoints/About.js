            Founder Joseph Plaugher spent years repeatedly experiencing
            ineffective, slow, and tedious processes being utilized at a variety
            of organizations of all sizes. Knowing the power of software to
            automate business processes (which has allowed companies such as
            Amazon, Ebay, Google, and many others to drastically cut costs and
            become superpowers in their industry), Joseph wanted to bring this
            competitive advantage to small businesses who can't neccessarily
            afford their own technology team.
