            Maybe you're not sure how or if software can benefit you and your
            business. We will seek to understand your pain point - the part of
            your business process that is inefficient, expensive, or just a
            hassle - and we will work to alleviate the "pain" and automate or
            streamline it using software. If you feel your business already runs
            pretty smoothly, we may still be able to improve upon your existing
            systems.
